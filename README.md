# Yet Another Renderer
This project is my way to fresh everything I know about rendering and graphics up and maybe try something new

## How to build

## Plans
Here I will note what I'd like to do maybe in details (or not)  
I would like to start from the beginning ~~again~~ it means from OpenGL. Despite the fact it is pretty old GAPI  
I still think that it is a good place to refresh basics in my head  
**What I'd like to do**:  
- OpenGL renderer 
    - Render 2D/3D objects
    - Basic light
    - Effects
    - Shadows
- Render layer
    - Shader reflection (HLSL/GLSL -> Sprir-v -> Renderer)
    - Render Abstraction (Like The-Forge or something like this)
- GUI (probably with ImGui)
    - Debug windows for Render targets output
    - Runtime shader recompilation
- Something else
